<h1>VidLearn Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025-11-25</p>

<p>Pengfei Gao ("we," "us," or "our") built the VidLearn Mac application (the "Application") as a freemium application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Application.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>VidLearn is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect minimal information necessary to provide and improve the service:</p>

<h3>1.1 Purchase Verification Data</h3>
<p>To activate Lifetime Pro features, the Application uses Apple's StoreKit 2 framework to verify your in-app purchases. This process is handled entirely by Apple and we only receive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Confirmation of your purchase status</li>
  <li>Transaction details necessary to validate your license</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not have access to your payment information, which is processed solely by Apple.</p>

<h3>1.2 Anonymous Crash and Performance Data</h3>
<p>If you have enabled "Share Mac Analytics" with developers in your system preferences, Apple may provide us with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aggregated, anonymized crash reports</li>
  <li>Anonymous performance data</li>
</ul>
<p>This data helps us identify and fix stability issues and cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect any of the following personal content:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The specific video files you use with the Application</li>
  <li>Content of your bookmarks or notes</li>
  <li>Words in your personal vocabulary bank</li>
  <li>Any other learning materials you create within the Application</li>
</ul>
<p>All your learning data remains private and is stored locally on your Mac.</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use the limited information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To verify and maintain your Lifetime Pro license status</li>
  <li>To improve Application stability and performance</li>
  <li>To fix bugs and crashes</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The Application uses the following third-party service:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> For in-app purchase verification. Your interaction with StoreKit is subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain purchase verification data for as long as your license is active to provide you with Pro features. Anonymous analytics data is retained only for as long as necessary to analyze Application performance.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting your information and implement appropriate technical measures to safeguard it. Since all your learning data is stored locally on your device, you maintain full control over your content.</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>VidLearn does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The Application is not directed at children under 13.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

<h2>9. Your Consent</h2>
<p>By using our Application, you consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>
